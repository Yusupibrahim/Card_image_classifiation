# Card_image_classifiation
in the project, I'm using a convolutional neural network to classify card image

**Goals** 
to identify each card label

**Insights**
using cnn approach or architecture has resulted in overfitting and reaching a validation accuracy of 82%

**Advices**
need added optimization on the model or add performance boost method to counter the overfitting and improve the result
